#Objects and Classes

##Overview

This lab is a followup to the lecture on Ruby Objects and Classes.

This app processes an order from a custoer. The customer has a credit limit available to purchase items. The app takes the customer order, checks the available credit, decrements the credit available based on the order, and prints out a receipt.

Initially the app uses a hash to store the customer info, the object of the lab is to replace the customer hash with a customer class object. 

The 000-StarterApp folder contains a working version of the application which you should run to get a feel for how the app works. 

You will do your work in the 001-Labwork folder. You can always refer the version in the 000_StarterApp folder to see how it works.

    ruby 000-StarterApp/app.rb

##Starter App Code Review

__On your own:__ review the code in the Starter App.

* What is it doing?
* What would you change and why?
* Is there anything which you don't understand?

__In your programming pair (or three):__

* Help each other understand, research if necessary
* Discuss what could be improved about this program



##Complete the Lab Steps by completing the code to make the tests pass

```
# Change to the labwork directory
cd 001-Labwork

# Edit the app.rb file in the 001-Labwork directory
subl .

# Run the Test Suite using rspec
rspec

Read the description that the failing test gives you and make changes accordingly.

Workflow note: It is helpful to divide screen with editor and terminal windows.
